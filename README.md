We must create a “realistic” 3D graphical
representation of the inside of a maze from a
first-person perspective.  we have to create this
representation using the Ray-Casting principles
mentioned earlier.


 We must use the miniLibX. Either the version that is available on the operating system, or from its sources. If you choose to work with the sources.
